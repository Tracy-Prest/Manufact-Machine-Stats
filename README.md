# Manufact-Machine-Status
The data set was gotten from KAGGELE to develop a machine learning model that predict the machine status of a manufacturing machine. The machine learning model include the use of logistic regression algorithm, random forest algorithm, and XGBoost. The various model had low accuracy score and this calls fpr further model improvement. Another file will be added but it will make use of pipelines.
